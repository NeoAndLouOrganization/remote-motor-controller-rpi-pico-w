# Raspberry pi OSs

- https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/

The OS Lite 64bit is compatible with Raspberry pi 4B, it is lightweight minimal image without the X-server window manager, related components, and other modules. It is headless, meaning it has no desktop UI.

Seems ideal to that project since we cannot operate camera software on micro controllers, and OS Lite will work well for deploying a server with to control the automated vehicle.
